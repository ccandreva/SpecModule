ZikulaSpecModule
============

### Beta (for discussion)

This is a module depicting the Core-2.0.0 Extension specification.

This is a module, but themes would share the same specification.

The module is installable, though it has no function. The module is documented throughout and is useful mainly
in solidifying and documenting the specification.
