Blocks
======

The `Block` directory contains all blocks provided by the module. Please see `/docs/Core-2.0/Blocks.md` in the Core
repository for more information.

This module contains three examples that are useful in different ways:

  1. BarBlock - a simple block implementing only the block interface.
  2. FooBlock - a more 'standard' example utilizing AbstractBlockController and providing configuration with Symfony forms.
  3. ServiceDefinedBlock - a simple block utilizing DI.
